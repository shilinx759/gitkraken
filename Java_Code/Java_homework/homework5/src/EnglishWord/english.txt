"Hello world!'

To me,you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred
thousand other little boys.And I have no need of you.And you,on your
part,have no need of me.To you,I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred
thousand other foxes.But if you tame me,then we shall need each other.To
me,you will be unique in all the world.To you,I shall be unique in all the
world.
